We have given a large number now we can easily find out the factorial of this large number using boost multiprevision Library.
Boost library has included a new multiprecision library in the current 1.53.0 release for C++ programmers who need more precision than 64 bits.

#include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp> 
using boost::multiprecision::cpp_int; 

inspite of using int you can use cpp_int and get the desired result.
