Today is very tough day for me as one of my good friends have birthday today. So i went out around 12 and reached home at 6:30. I was tired and my stomach was also full. Then i decided to rest for sometime but won't able to sleep because in my family sleeping in evening is considered to be wrong.
So woke and  tried to study but i was not able to concentrate . Morever i was not in mood of doing anything but i don't know from where i got motivation to get up and exercise . I exercised for 45 mins and then had bath . Aaj code ka bhe scene ho gya subh theory padhne me code ni kiya and abhi raat ho gye , but i m promising myself i will definately catch and kal day10 tak ka code complete hoga.

think of the day why you started , waha se motivation mil jayega hamesha , it's ok ki har din same ni hote , jis din time mile sare pending task kar do.

Happy Coding 
Happy Exercising
Happy Bathing
baaki share ni kar sakta...............
